Description: Implements the matching and synthetic control estimator of Kellogg, Mogstad, Pouliot, and Torgovitsky (2021). This takes a convex combination of a nearest neighbor estimator and a synthetic control estimator. The number of neighbors and the weight used to combine them with SC are selected by a rolling-origin recalibration procedure.
