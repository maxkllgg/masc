Description: Implements the matching and synthetic control estimator of Kellogg, Mogstad, Pouliot, and Torgovitsky (2019). This takes a convex combination of a nearest neighbor estimator and a synthetic control estimator. The nearest neighbor estimator used and the weight used to combine the two estimators are selected by a rolling-origin recalibration procedure.
